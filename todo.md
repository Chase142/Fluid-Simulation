We want a website that has a wing.

Sean - Liam : Fix algs. Make it look pretty. Velocity not increasing, Chase says zero divergence probably not enforced. Remove diffusion, gravity?
Chase: Plotly is ugly make pretty.
Debo: UI, need stuff like mouse position, some key press events, into the host backend. Also make look pretty.

Long term:
User drawing.
Wing objects.
Genetic algorithm user drawing to better aerodynamics.
More boundary conditions inlet velocity profiles? Wind tunnel is probably good enough.
